    <h1> Directions </h1>
    <ol type="1">
        <li> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li> 
        <li> To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until
            mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to
            hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
        <li> Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness
            of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough 1 ½
            inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.</li> 
        <li> Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan.
            Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
       
        <li> To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt
            in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.</li> 
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40
            to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks. </li>
        
        <li> Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li> 
    </ol>

    <h1> To Prepare Mashed Pumpkin: </h1>
    Cut a fresh pie pumpkin in half. Scoop out and discard seeds and stringy portions. Leave skin on and cut pumpkin
    into chunks. Measure out 1 ½ pounds for this recipe to yield 2 cups of mashed, cooked pumpkin. If your pumpkin is
    larger, consider cooking 3 pounds and doubling the pie recipe above to make two pies.
    </p>
    <p> Place pumpkin chunks in saucepan over medium heat with 1 inch water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low,
        cover, and simmer until tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool. Remove and discard peel. Return pumpkin to the
        saucepan and mash with a potato masher or use a food mill until smooth.
